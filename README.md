_**fun fact:** i made this game in my first year of learning python for a school assignment and i handed it in early but it never got marked..._ :pensive: 

_(also in the process of coding, i lost all my work bc my usb broke and i had no backup so i had to rewrite it all again!!)_ :unamused: 
lesson learnt! :v:
